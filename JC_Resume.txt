BUILDING THE DECENTRALIZED FUTURE
I don't just write code; I architect resilience.
As a Senior Blockchain Architect and Systems Engineer, I operate at the bleeding edge of what's possible in decentralized technology. From engineering censorship-resistant operating systems (Prism OS) to optimizing high-frequency blockchain nodes (Citadel), my work defines the next generation of the internet. If you are solving the hardest problems in Web3, P2P networking, or high-concurrency systems, you aren't just looking for a developer—you're looking for me.

TECHNICAL SKILLS
- Blockchain & Web3: Rust, Solidity, Solana (Anchor), Libp2p, Gossipsub, UTXO Models, Smart Contracts
- Full Stack Engineering: Python (Django/Flask), Node.js, Next.js, React, TypeScript, WebSocket
- Systems & Cloud: Linux, Bash, Git, Docker, CI/CD, AWS, SQLite, RocksDB, PostgreSQL
- Core Competencies: Distributed Systems, P2P Networking, Asynchronous Programming, Leadership

ENGINEERING CASE STUDIES & EXPERIENCE

Lead Software Architect | Prism OS (Open Source)
2024 - Present
Architected a decentralized, offline-first operating system focused on censorship resistance.
- Concurrency at Scale: Overcame Python's GIL limitations by engineering a custom AsyncIO event loop to handle thousands of concurrent P2P connections without blocking.
- Trust Topology: Designed a graph-based "Web of Trust" algorithm to calculate reputation scores locally, preventing sybil attacks in an anonymous network.
- Traffic Visualization: Built a real-time network traffic visualizer using Canvas API to debug packet flow.

Blockchain Engineer | Citadel Core
2024 - Present
Developed a high-performance blockchain node in Rust from scratch.
- P2P Propagation: Implemented Gossipsub via Libp2p to optimize block broadcasting, reducing propagation latency by 40%.
- Storage Optimization: Designed a RocksDB-based storage layer with a custom UTXO schema for heavily concurrent access.
- Consensus Safety: Wrote rigorous unit and integration tests to verify consensus rules under high-load mining simulations.

Full Stack Web3 Developer | Golden Banana (Solana Project)
2024 - Present
Built a comprehensive GameFi dApp on Solana using the Anchor framework and Next.js.
- Smart Contract Logic: Engineered the "Feeding Protocol" program in Rust/Anchor, managing secure token state.
- State Synchronization: Solved game state desync issues by implementing optimistic UI updates and WebSocket RPC subscriptions.
- Wallet Integration: Integrated Solana adapter wallets (Phantom, Solflare) with robust error handling.

Senior Frontend Engineer | FleetOps Management System
2024 - Present
Led the modernization of a legacy fleet management platform to React.
- Code Quality Overhaul: Enforced strict linting (ESLint) and typing standards (TypeScript) to eliminate hydration mismatches.
- Real-Time Tracking: Implemented map-based asset tracking using WebSocket feeds, optimizing re-renders for fleets with 500+ vehicles.

Systems Engineer | Cloud Lite Coin
2024 - Present
Hardened network security and implemented AI-driven analysis tools.
- Heuristic Analysis: Developed a static analysis tool (`will_it_halt`) to detect infinite loops in smart contract code.
- Network Security: Audited and patched P2P listeners against DDOS vectors, implementing rate-limiting.
